# Madlibs-Generator
Python program designed to create customised stories by replacing placeholders in a template with user-provided words. This project allows users to have fun and be creative by generating unique stories every time they run the program.

gen.py and story.txt must be in the same folder.

Instructions:
1. Create the Story Template
   - Create a text file named 'story.txt' in the same directory as the 'gen.py' script.
   - Write your story in `story.txt`, using '<>' to enclose words that will be replaced by user input. For example:
   
     Once upon a time in a <place>, there lived a <adjective> <animal>.
     
2. Run the Script:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing gen.py and story.txt.
   - Run gen.py and add the words you want to use through the terminal.
